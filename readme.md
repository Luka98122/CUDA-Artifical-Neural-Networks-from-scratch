This repository contains my implementation of **artificial neural networks from scratch in Python**, built using only **NumPy** for computation and **Matplotlib** for visualization.

The project follows and expands upon the *Neural Networks from Scratch* tutorial series by **Sentdex**, with the goal of deeply understanding how neural networks work internally—without relying on high-level frameworks understanding.
